# g. While you are working on this feature, imagine that one critical bug is reported in the main branch, and you need to switch back to the ‘dev’ branch, create fixes, and apply them while keeping your ‘feature/sqrt’ branch up-to-date. For this, you need to create

# Q.2: For a project that deals with large binary files, integrate Git LFS (Large File Storage) to handle these files efficiently. Demonstrate how to add, commit, and push binary files to the repository, ensuring they are tracked by Git LFS correctly. Clone the repository on another machine to verify that the binary files are downloaded correctly.

# Q.3: In this same GitHub repository, create a new branch ‘geometry-calculator’, we'll work on a simple Python program that calculates the area of a circle and the area of a rectangle. We'll use Git stash to switch between working on multiple features (calculating circle area and calculating rectangle area) without committing incomplete changes.

## b. Stash Changes for Circle Area Feature:

## - Before committing the changes, stash them using git stash to save the incomplete feature implementation.

## - Verify that the working directory is clean
