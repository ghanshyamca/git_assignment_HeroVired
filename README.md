# g. While you are working on this feature, imagine that one critical bug is reported in the main branch, and you need to switch back to the ‘dev’ branch, create fixes, and apply them while keeping your ‘feature/sqrt’ branch up-to-date. For this, you need to create

# h. After completing the feature implementation and ensuring that the application works correctly, create a pull request targeting the main branch.

# Q.2: For a project that deals with large binary files, integrate Git LFS (Large File Storage) to handle these files efficiently. Demonstrate how to add, commit, and push binary files to the repository, ensuring they are tracked by Git LFS correctly. Clone the repository on another machine to verify that the binary files are downloaded correctly.
